.Abstract


A wiper speed control system for an automotive wiper controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with rain conditions. The control system includes a rain sensor detecting rain conditions to produce . an analog signal having an amplitude depending upon the detected rain conditions. The analog sensor signal is converted into a digital pulse signal by a converter for application to a digital circuit system. A control signal is produced by digitally processing the pulse signal. The control signal is applied to a wiper driver circuit to adjust the operational speed or timing in accordance with the control signal.
